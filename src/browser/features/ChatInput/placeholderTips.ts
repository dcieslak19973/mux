/**
 * Tip carousel for the ChatInput placeholder.
 *
 * The workspace ChatInput uses these strings as a rotating "Type a message..."
 * placeholder so users who never read docs still get passive exposure to
 * slash commands they probably don't know about.
 *
 * The tip rotates on a wall-clock bucket (not per-message, not per-workspace)
 * so switching between chats never reshuffles the visible tip. Two tabs open
 * to two workspaces show the same tip; close and re-open the app inside the
 * same bucket and you still see the same tip. The bucket boundary is the
 * only thing that advances the carousel.
 *
 * Every tip in this list must surface a real, always-available input feature:
 * a slash command (registry or built-in skill) that is ungated by experiments
 * (no `experimentGate` on the command definition), a backslash symbol shortcut
 * (see `symbolShortcuts.ts`, which is always on), or an always-available global
 * keybind from `KEYBINDS` (ungated by experiments). Advertising an unimplemented
 * or feature-flag-locked command sends the user into an unknown-command /
 * experiment-required dead end the moment they follow the suggestion. When
 * adding a slash-command tip, grep
 * `src/browser/utils/slashCommands/registry.ts` for `experimentGate` to make
 * sure the command you're surfacing isn't gated. Keybind tips are rendered via
 * `formatKeybind` so they stay platform-correct (⌘ on macOS, Ctrl elsewhere).

 * `floor(NOW / 20min) mod PLACEHOLDER_TIPS.length` — so any reorder of or
 * insertion into PLACEHOLDER_TIPS shifts the displayed tip and cascades into
 * a fresh Chromatic baseline diff on every ChatInput story (currently 100+).
 *
 * Pinning to index 0 means tip-list edits only affect snapshots when the lead
 * tip's text itself changes, which is the rare, intentional case. /orchestrate
 * is the lead tip because it's the only entry-point users have for the
 * unadvertised orchestrate skill — making it the storybook-fixed tip turns
 * every ChatInput snapshot into passive discovery surface for the feature.
